		By default, both unordered lists and list items are block level elements, but by setting their display property to inline-block, you can get them to display side by side in the nav.

		I want the bot logo to be floating on the rather top left side of this page.
		Or can even make the bot logo move across the top of the screen as the page is scrolled.
		And can even have a road picture across the top of the screen, with sections written on the road and the logo going across.
		I want the bullet points to be bus stop signs

			<h2>Origins</h2>

				<p>Started in Dec 2015, the idea started a few months back where Angus Ng, Founder,  Hostgagements thought of having a more convenient way (read: lesser taps) of checking bus arrival timings than the official one. As Telegram bots were very popular then, it seemed natural to jump on the bandwagon.</p>

				<p>A demo created by Bernard's friend made him reverse his initial impression of a low usage utility. Moving forward, more bus services and features are constantly added to make it more applicable and accessible to more, contributing to the society, in line with Hostgagements's corporate social responsibility arm.</p>
